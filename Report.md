# TAF Report

### LAYERS

##### In my homework i have used such layers of TAF:
* Test logic layer
* Test logic realization layer
* Work with test data layer
* Test run layer
* Config layer
* Utils layer

##### I have missed layers such as:
* Report and logs layer
* Service layer

##### To improve current solution I can use:

* Allure for reports and any log library to make a "Report and logs" layer
* Test data could be stored in some database to provide "Service" layer
